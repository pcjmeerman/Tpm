    "1. During the early days of the covid 19 pandemic, many scientists from arround the world turned to their prefered modeling tools to provide insight into how the pandemic might unfold and what actions governments should take. One particular model which made headlines around the globe was developed by a group at Imperial in the UK. This model was derived from an earlier 2005 model for Thailand to study how a mutated version of H5N1 avian flu might spread. In follow up work, the authors reparameterized this model for the UK to study possible deadly flu strains. Without going into the specifics of the imperial model, what can you say more theoretically about the strengths and weaknesses of using ABMs to study pandemic outbreaks at a country level? List 3 strenghts and 3 weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a range of ways in which you can answer this question. What matters is that you build on the key characteristics of ABMs: local interaction amongst heterogenous agents. So an ABM can be used to study how a pandemic might arise out of local interactions. However, you need detailed microlevel data about your population (age, susceptability, travel patterns, etc.). The runtime of such a model will be huge. And the uncertainties will be massive because of the detailed microlevel data. It is thus also questionable whether you can make detailed predictions about how a pandemic will unfold. \n",

    "Possible strengths\n",
    "1. Detailed representation of different spreading mechanisms (public spaces, public transport, work, schoolls, homes. This in turn enables explored in more detail the possible effects of targeted interventions (e.g. closing schools, reducing use of public transport). \n",
    "2. bottom up perspective is simple to understand, and key data required for ODE based models might become an emergent property in the ABM model. \n",
    "3. ABM enables encoding heterogeneity directly, rather than having to be decided on during modeling (i.e. how to compartmentalize your population). The bottom up perspective also enables encoding social networks more directly. \n",
